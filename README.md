# Array Reverser

This is a simple Java console application that takes an array from user input and prints it in reverse order.

## 💡 How It Works

1. The user is asked how many elements the array will have.
2. The user inputs the array elements one by one.
3. The program then displays the array in reverse order.

## 🧪 Example

```
Enter the number of elements in the array: 4
Enter element 0: 10
Enter element 1: 20
Enter element 2: 30
Enter element 3: 40
Reversed array:
40 30 20 10
```

## 📁 Project Structure
